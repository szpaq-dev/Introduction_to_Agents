# Introduction to AI Agents — Annotated PDF

This repository provides an accessible, annotated copy of **“Introduction to Agents and Agent Architectures” (November 2025)**. The document offers a structured walkthrough of modern agentic systems, from basic reasoning loops to multi-agent orchestration and deployment.

## Overview

The PDF is intended as a practical guide for developers, architects, and researchers looking to understand or build AI agents. It summarises the core conceptual and architectural components behind contemporary agent frameworks.

## What's Inside

- **Agent architecture fundamentals**  
  Model (reasoning), Tools (action), Orchestration (control).

- **The agentic problem-solving loop**  
  How agents iteratively *Think → Act → Observe* to accomplish goals.

- **A taxonomy of agent capabilities**  
  From basic tool-using agents to collaborative and self-evolving systems.

- **Practical engineering guidance**  
  Tooling, context management, memory, safety, deployment, and evaluation.

- **Design patterns for multi-agent systems**  
  Coordinator, sequential workflows, iterative refinement, HITL integration.

## Why This Repository

Agentic systems are advancing quickly, but many explanations are either too high-level or too tightly tied to specific implementations. This annotated PDF serves as a stable, conceptual reference for anyone exploring agent design or building production-grade systems.

## How to Use

- View or download the PDF directly.
- Use it as a baseline architecture reference for your own agent projects.
- Share it with colleagues who need a quick introduction to agent concepts.
